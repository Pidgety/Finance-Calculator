## About this project

This is a finance calculator program that allows the user to:

* calculate an investment's value after applying simple interest
* calculate an investment's value after applying compound interest
* calculate the monthly repayment amounts for a mortgage

## Technologies

## Instructions for use

The main menu prompts to select one of two calculators:

### Investment - calculate interest earned on an investment

The user is prompted to enter:
* an investment amount
* an interest rate percentage
* the investment period in years
* whether they want to calculate **simple** or **compound** interest

The program then calculates and displays the total amount (capital + interest) after the given period.

### Mortgage - calculate monthly repayment amounts

The user is prompted to enter:
* the current value of a property
* the interest rate percentage

The program then calculates and displays the monthly repayment amount based on the information provided.

## Potential improvements

* include a wider range of calculators
* add a graphical user interface
* provide the option to enter the mortgage period in months or years
